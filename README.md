
Gcalendar was my first python project (Started 2013-07-27), born out of not having reliable gui popups for Google Calendar. I wanted to emulate Microsoft Office reminders, and this is what I came up with.



Gcalendar's codebase was based off of gcalcli, a command line interface with Google Calander

Since this was my first introduction to Python, not everything is very Pythonic. I have had an action Item to fix things up, but haven't had the motivation since things still worked.
